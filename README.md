## Problem Statement
In the face of natural and man-made calamities, timely and efficient coordination among rescue agencies is paramount to saving lives and mitigating damage. However, the lack of a centralized platform that registers and displays the locations of these agencies can hinder the effectiveness of disaster response efforts. This problem statement aims to address this critical need by describing the development of an application that serves as a comprehensive hub for registering all rescue relief agencies and visualizing their real-time locations during emergencies.
